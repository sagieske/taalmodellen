		Sentence 1 : Phoo phoo replied Charles what's an evening party Never worth 
		remembering Your father might have asked us to dinner I think if he had wanted 
		to see us You may do as you like but I shall go to the play
		
	Sentence 2 : There was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse on another 
	subject They must speak of the accident at Lyme Lady Russell had not been arrived 
	five minutes the day before when a full account of the whole had burst on her but 
	still it must be talked of she must make enquiries she must regret the imprudence 
	lament the result and Captain Wentworth's name must be mentioned by both Anne was 
	conscious of not doing it so well as Lady Russell She could not speak the name and 
	look straight forward to Lady Russell's eye till she had adopted the expedient of 
	telling her briefly what she thought of the attachment between him and Louisa When 
	this was told his name distressed her no longer
	
	
	Sentence 3 : Her jealous eye was satisfied in one particular Captain Wentworth was 
	acknowledged again by each by Elizabeth more graciously than before She even 
	addressed him once and looked at him more than once Elizabeth was in fact revolving 
	a great measure The sequel explained it After the waste of a few minutes in saying 
	the proper nothings she began to give the invitation which was to comprise all the 
	remaining dues of the Musgroves To morrow evening to meet a few friends no formal 
	party It was all said very gracefully and the cards with which she had provided 
	herself the Miss Elliot at home were laid on the table with a courteous comprehensive 
	smile to all and one smile and one card more decidedly for Captain Wentworth The 
	truth was that Elizabeth had been long enough in Bath to understand the importance 
	of a man of such an air and appearance as his The past was nothing The present was 
	that Captain Wentworth would move about well in her drawing room The card was 
	pointedly given and Sir Walter and Elizabeth arose and disappeared
	
	Sentence 4 : You will stay I am sure you will stay and nurse her cried he turning 
	to her and speaking with a glow and yet a gentleness which seemed almost restoring 
	the past She coloured deeply and he recollected himself and moved away She expressed 
	herself most willing ready happy to remain It was what she had been thinking of and 
	wishing to be allowed to do A bed on the floor in Louisa's room would be sufficient 
	for her if Mrs Harville would but think so
	
	Sentence 5 : Winthrop however or its environs for young men are sometimes to be 
	met with strolling about near home was their destination and after another half 
	mile of gradual ascent through large enclosures where the ploughs at work and the 
	fresh made path spoke the farmer counteracting the sweets of poetical despondence 
	and meaning to have spring again they gained the summit of the most considerable hill 
	which parted Uppercross and Winthrop and soon commanded a full view of the latter at 
	the foot of the hill on the other side

	again they gained the summit of the most considerable hill which parted Uppercross and 
	Winthrop and soon commanded a full view of the latter at the foot of the hill on the 
	other side
	
	Sentence 4 : Are you serious cried Mary her eyes brightening Dear me that's a very good 
	thought very good indeed To be sure I may just as well go as not for I am of no use at 
	home am I and it only harasses me You who have not a mother's feelings are a great deal 
	the properest person You can make little Charles do anything he always minds you at a 
	word It will be a great deal better than leaving him only with Jemima Oh I shall 
	certainly go I am sure I ought if I can quite as much as Charles for they want me 
	excessively to be acquainted with Captain Wentworth and I know you do not mind being 
	left alone An excellent	thought of yours indeed Anne I will go and tell Charles 
	and get ready directly You can send for us you know at a moment's notice if 
	anything is the matter but I dare say there will be nothing to alarm you 
	I should not go you may be sure if I did not feel quite at ease about my dear child
	
	Sentence 5 : Mr Shepherd was eloquent on the subject pointing out all the circumstances 
	of the Admiral's family which made him peculiarly desirable as a tenant He was a married 
	man and without children the very state to be wished for A house was never taken good 
	care of Mr Shepherd observed without a lady he did not know whether furniture might not 
	be in danger of suffering as much where there was no lady as where there were many 
	children A lady without a family was the very best preserver of furniture 
	in the world He had seen Mrs Croft too she was at Taunton with the admiral 
	and had been present almost all the time they were talking the matter over

	\item \textit{Explain the differences between the models.}\\
	When using add-one smoothing, every unseen event gets the same probability assigned to. On the
	other hand, with Good-Turing smoothing the probability for unseen events is better divided.
