various sections of the Wall Street Journal corpus. We will describe the research question
that we wanted to answer, how we approached the problem and what our results were.  }

\section*{Introduction}
The problem that needed to be solved during the four assignments was how to calculate the most
probable Part-of-speach (POS) tag sequence using tagging and smoothing on a training corpus. The
program that needed to be written would eventually be able to tag the test corpus with POS tags.

Constructing language models is an interesting and important research, because it enables language
scientists to examine
